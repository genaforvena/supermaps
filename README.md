Android Maps

An extension on top of Android's Google Maps that allows for live views as Annotations. 
The current implementation of GoogleMaps for Android only allows for Bitmaps to be markers. 
This makes it incredibly hard and expensive to animate custom views as markers.

This is similar to the MapKit API for iOS and OSX.
